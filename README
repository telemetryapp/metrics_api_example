TelemetryTV Metrics API Example
===============================

This is an example of how to use the TelemetryTV Metrics API.  This uses node.js as an example platform for querying a metric from a local MongoDB database and sending it to the TelemetryTV API.

You will need to have node.js installed and have passing familiarity with it in order to use this example.  Additionally you will need to have a MongoDB database installed with a database named _database_ and an _accounts_ collection with some objects in it.

When this program runs it will send the count of the accounts collection to the 'accounts.count' metric in your TelemetryTV account.

## Running the Example

You'll need to CD to the source code directory and run the following command to execute the program, replacing _abc123_ with your API Token from the [https://app.telemetrytv.com/settings/apitokens](TelemetryTV API Token Page):

`./metrics.js -t abc123`
